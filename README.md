# giftastic

 In this app, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task,need call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of site.
When the user clicks on the name of a bird name, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will become static.

Rating is displaying after every gif.
